# 1> Make sure git submodules are up to date:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive

```

# 2> Need to build cmake from source:

# 3> Create a build directory:

```
mkdir build
cd build

```
# Configure the project with CMake. Check out the additional configuration options.

```
cmake .. -DETHASHCUDA=OFF -DETHASHCL=ON

```

# (Optional, Linux only) Install the built executable:

```
make
sudo make install

```
